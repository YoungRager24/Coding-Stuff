Program 1: Yummy Catering provides meals for parties and special events. Write a program that prompts the user for the number of guests attending an event and then computes the total price, which is $35 per person. Display the company motto with the border that you created in the YummyMotto2 class in Chapter 1, and then display the number of guests, price per guest, and total price. Also display a message that indicates true or false depending on whether the job is classified as a large event—an event with 50 or more guests. 

Yummy Catering provides meals for parties and special events. Continuing the lab above, modify the program so that the main() method contains only three executable statements that each call a method as follows: 

 

> The first executable statement calls a public static int method that prompts the user for the number of guests and returns the value to the main() method. 

 

> The second executable statement calls a public static void method that displays the company motto with the border. 

 

> The last executable statement passes the number of guests to a public static void method that computes the price of the event, displays the price, and displays whether the event is a large event.

Program 2: Sunshine Seashore Supplies rents beach equipment such as kayaks, canoes, beach chairs, and umbrellas to tourists. Write a program that prompts the user for the number of minutes the user rented a piece of sports equipment. Compute the rental cost as $40 per hour plus $1 per additional minute. (You might have surmised already that this rate has a logical flaw, but for now, calculate rates as described here. You can fix the problem after you learn about decision making.) Display Sunshine's motto with the border that you created in the SunshineMotto2 class in Assignment 1. Then display the hours, minutes, and total price.

 

Sunshine Seashore Supplies rents beach equipment such as kayaks, canoes, beach chairs, and umbrellas to tourists. Continuing the program from above, modify the program so that the main() method contains only three executable statements that each call a method as follows: 

 

> The first executable statement calls a method that prompts the user for the rental time in minutes and returns the value to the main() method. 

 

> The second executable statement calls a method that displays the company motto with the border. 

 

> The last executable statement passes the number of minutes to a method that computes the hours, extra minutes, and price for the rental and then displays all the details.
