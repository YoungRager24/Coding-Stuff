							📣 Attention CPT 236 Students! 📣
Get ready for an exciting challenge in Test 1! You'll be tasked with writing a Java program that plays the classic game of rock, paper, scissors.

Here's what you need to know:

📝 Program Prompt: Your assignment is to create a Java program that simulates a game of rock, paper, scissors. Your program should allow the user to play against the computer and accurately determine the winner based on the choices made.

For the program, use message dialogs and confirmation dialogs to display and take input from the user.

Use a random number generator to determine what the computer plays.  (hint use Random class)

Ex. Random randNum = new Random(); //don’t forget to import Random

After playing one round of RPS, ask the user if they want to play again? If they want to play again, allow them to play again, if not, thank the user and end the program.

NOTE: Don’t forget to name your project: yourName_cpt236_Test1.

NOTE: Don’t forget to add comments in your files.

NOTE: Don’t forget to submit your whole project folder and not just the java files.

🕒 Test Timing: Test 1 will start at 6:30 PM. You must log on to Teams and cut your camera.

📹 Camera Policy: Remember, it's mandatory to keep your cameras turned on throughout the duration of the test. This ensures a fair testing environment and helps maintain academic integrity.
